Shortcuts: "r" is to restart the game. "c" is to get in a castling position. "d" is to get in a castling
position in which you already moved the king (so you can see that you cant castle in that case).
"f" is to get into a check in one position. "g" is to get into a mate in one position. "y" is to get
into a position where you cannot castle because of it leading the king to be in check. "p" is to get in
a position where you can promote a pawn.
